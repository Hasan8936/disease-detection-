# Pneumonia Detection with Deep Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`pneumenia.ipynb`) focused on building and evaluating a deep learning model to detect pneumonia, potentially using chest X-ray images.

## Project Overview

Pneumonia is a serious lung infection that can be life-threatening if not diagnosed early. Medical imaging, particularly chest X-rays, plays a key role in diagnosis. This project aims to leverage deep learning techniques to automate the detection of pneumonia from images, assisting radiologists and healthcare professionals.

Dataset
(Replace with details about the dataset you used — e.g. links, licenses, sizes)

Example:

This project uses the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset available on Kaggle.
The dataset contains training, validation, and test images classified as normal or pneumonia.

Results
(Replace with summary of your model’s performance.)

Example:

The model achieved 94.5% accuracy on the test set, demonstrating strong potential for aiding pneumonia diagnosis from X-ray images.
